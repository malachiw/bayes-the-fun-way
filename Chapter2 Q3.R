# Measuring Uncertainty
# The Yankess are playing the Red Sox. You're a diehard Sox fan and bet your 
# friend they'll win the game. You'll pay your friend $30 if the Sox lose and
# your friend will have to pay you only $5 if the Sox win. What is the 
# probability you have intuitively assigned to the belief that the Red Sox will
# win?

# P(win)/P(lose) = 30/5 = 6
# P(win) = 6*P(lose)
# P(win) = 6*(1-P(win))
# P(win) = 6*6-P(win)
# 7*P(win) = 6
6/7 # = P(win)
